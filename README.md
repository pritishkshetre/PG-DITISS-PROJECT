**#Title:- Devise a methodology for conducting VAPT on IoT Devices & Network
**
#Description:- The aim of the project is to develop a methodology for conducting Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing - VAPT on IoT devices and IoT networks. In this project, We integrate various testing techniques, tools, and procedure to evaluate weakness, simulate real world attack scenarios and enhanced the security of the IoT devices and network. The devised methodology aims to provide a structured comprehensive solution by enforcing security policies and measures on the IoT devices. We will study about IoT ecosystem, which involves IoT devices, Applications used in IoT communication, the various network protocols used for IoT communication. The outcome of the project is a methodology that can be used to conduct VAPT on IoT ecosystem.

#Platform Used:- Contiki OS, CentOS, Ubuntu, Kali OS, various tools and technologies used for IoT VAPT
